  This Processor is lightening fast. Absolutely one of the best in the market and faster than most any other processor. Totally brilliant and one of the best in the market for high end gaming. This is for a gaming rig I hooked up for my kids. It was long overdue.I am using a Asus TUF Gaming X570-PLUS motherboard with this AMD Ryzen-5 3600 MHz 6-Core processor with a Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM. My graphics card is ASUS Radeon RX 580 8GB Dual-Fan OC Edition GDDR5. The PSU is Corsair RM650. I'm using two hard disks in this. The booting is Western Digital WD Blue SSD 250 GB SATA III and the bulk storage is a standard 1 TB Seagate Baracuda as the secondary. All this is housed in a Corsair Carbide Series CC-9011050-WW cabinet. I'm using Samsung 27 inch Curved LED Backlit Computer Monitor and Redgear Pro Series Wired Gamepad. The keyboard mouse combo is Redgear Manta MT21 Gaming Keyboard. The sound is from F&D F-203G 2.1 Channel Multimedia Speakers System. Everything is bought here on Amazon within days of each other and it is perfectly matched.I recommend this processor and whole setup to anyone interested in building a top-of-the-line gaming computer that will not be outdated anytime soon.Highly recommended.

  Bought precisely for gaming and streaming. Looked around for an year or so before building a gaming pc. I was skeptical in Intel and Ryzen but finally laid my hands on this beast due to cost per core scenario. It beats Intel in all tests apart from single core tasks which i beleive not an issue for me.If you are looking for something cost effective and have a beastly performance, without a doubt just go for it. I using it with rtx 2060, ssd 500gb and 8gb RAM and beleive me yiu will get that butter smooth experience you always wanted to have.

  Got This For 18500<U+20B9> Bit Expensive Due To Lockdown.But Other Than That, Talking About The Processing; It Still Outperforms Intel i5 10th Gen Chips. Good Gaming As Well As Overall Performance. It Should Be Around 17000<U+20B9>. That Would Be A Steal Deal. If You're Ready To Pay Around 20000<U+20B9>, I Will Suggest You To Wait For Upcoming AMD's 4000 Or 5000 Series Or Go With 3600XT Instead.

  First of all I wanted to be safe in the side of bios. So I went off with a b450 tomahawk max motherboard from msi and it was preflashed for 3rd gen ryzen processor. Nobody in the review said that. So don't buy a motherboard which you are not sure of bios. The processor is cool but, now I've started thinking that I should have went for the 3600x it's a lot value for money with a cooler of that grade. This cooler is not that great and don't expect much from it.

  Processor is a monsters among monsters for the value though please keep some extra bigs for additional water cooling as without cooling it's not going to survive those heavy tasks.I would prefer save yourself 3k and bug 3600 with a good cooling and then overclock it too 4.3 ghz and you are good to go.Feed it good 3200mhz ram sticks too.With a decent vram motherboard that's it.In the end it can handle any game you throw at it and streaming rendering is no surprise it's best in budget.

   I ordered for a ryzen5 3600 and got delivered a ryzen 5 3600x for the price tag of 16k. I just got a bit lucky I guess but amd beats intel in productivity  but you will need to overclock ryzen to get the same gaming performance as intel and also you'll need a good cooler . The stock cooler in the bOx is also good. Don't think twice just buy the processor and pair it woth a 3000 mhz or faster ram to get the awesome performance.

  One of the best processor under17k best core and thread speed. It gives you 6 core and 12 thread and if you pair this processor with rtx 2060 this Combination becomes devil awesome gaming performance and editing. always upto 70 fps on ultra settings on latest 2020 games if you building 75k place then go for this combination. you can do streaming and editing easily without any problems,this product is best value for money.

  Very good processor. Got it at Rs 16750. With  stock cooler, I set the  voltage at 1.15v at 4ghz and I am  getting  cinebench R20 score of  about 3500-3600 with  max temps of 77C. When I  ran Intel burn in  test , I got stable  results with max  temp of 82C. Still not bad for a stock cooler.  However I will upgrade to a different  cooler  soon and will update the review.

  This is by far the best processor you can get for your home build. It has already been reviewed quite extensively so I won't mentioj same thing again. I would recommend to use a third-party CPU cooler like cooler master if you want below 50 temperatures. AMD cooler is decent enough for daily needs but the idle temperatures remain a bit in high 50s. However this is in no way a drawback of the cpu.

  Amazingly Good one. But it has a huge problem with Adobe products installation when it comes to Hackintosh Mac. Otherwise for FCP on Big Sur and All Creative suits on Windows, everything is cool and fast as it mentioned. Definitely it will work fine for up to 5 years. Lets see. But if you have the budget go for intel, which is the stable one without glitches and small minor errors. Avoid price fights and choose what is needed as per situation.I am 97% Satisfied with this product.

  Bugget pc buildI Love this cpu although it is my first pc build in my life. I choose the Ryzen 5 3600 cpu for gaming and productivity purpose.Received product is very nice but a black plastic like thing it attached with cpu fan's thermal paste area,it is not a big deal.1. For gaming this cpu is enough for meplaying all games at 1080p and at higher fps.2. When I bought this cpu it's not value for money. I pay almost of Rs-18,000/- that isRS-17,964/-3. But what can I do,AMD gives you a lot of facilities no need to tell all knows that.4. Other features like specifications you can Google it.  Genuine product received  Through  Genuine Seller

  Working flawlessly with A320 motherboard (Make sure BIOS is updated which usually is with new A320 models) I have paired it with GTX 1660 and 16GB 3200 MHZ RAM.Very powerful processor easily handles latest games on Maximum settings at 1080p. If you're having temperature issues you can turn off Turbo boost (Core Performance Boost) or just get a better cooler like Deepcool Gammax 400 V2 (Which is 1500 Rupees) since the stock cooler is not good for Indian summer climates like Mumbai summers.This review was written after more than a month of use.

  Ryzen 5 3600 is very powerful cpu. the only problem? the temps are around 40-50ish in hot conditions. i suggest to throw away the stock \"wraith fan\" and use better cooler fans from deep cool or cooler master. the voltages are fluctuating a bit whne put on idle mode but i guess its the problem with all ryzen 5 3600 cpu.

  Don't but Ryzen 5 3600 at now  because it is so freaking over priced right now,  so Intel i5 10400f is best value for money at 15000<U+20B9>  . I would prefer buy Intel i5 10100f over buying ryzen 5 3600 . There is huge price  drop in intel i5 10400f  on the other hand r5 3600 priceing  is too high (20-23k <U+20B9>) , which is no value for money . But on the YouTube  many channels are still adulating r5 3600 , which is totally biased .I am going to but r5 3600 because I have already bought am4 socket based motherboard and 3200mhz ram so I haven't have any option to change my decision because I have watched a lots of YouTube video but they never recommend Intel i5 10400f that's why I decided to buy r5 3600 . So  there is only one option for me to wait until r5 3600 price drop.

  I hate how everyone here is talking about the processor but not the product so here's one from me. I order this processor at July end but received it almost 15 days later. THIS PROCESSOR IS A TOASTER. I've had serious heating issues with the stock Wraith cooler that is provided with it. Temps have reached 95 degrees c in games like FarCry 5 even with the best cabinet airflow. However, a friend of mine who purchased the same processor from Prime ABGB had no such heating issues at all. After some research this brought me to the conclusion that CPU temperature handling is dependent on something called Binning. If your processor had a better binning process then definitely your temps will be lower. This unfortunately is not in control of the manufacturer as these processors are manufactured in lots. So I'd highly recommended this processor for gaming provided you're ready to invest in a good quality cooler.

  It is the best processor for 2019 budget builders. AMD is always a better option for future proofing your system. i5-9600K is a little better(also costlier) if you're gaming but if you're buying it for rendering videos and images/models, this bad boy defeats i7-8700k by a slight margin(which costs twice as much, for that money Ryzen 7 3700X will destroy it and even a 9700K). So definitely the best processor for under 20000 indian rupees.

  AMD has come a long way and we should appreciate that. However, still it still not a good option. It's a 6 core CPU and doesn't have inbuilt graphicsIn the same price you can get Coe i5 9400f which is also a 6 Core CPU.Believe or not Intel Processors still performs solid In terms of single core performance.

  What to say except that this is probably the best AMD CPU out there for price performance match. No matter how you look at it. I am no expert, but all you have to do is look online for reviews and you will see it is nearly competent with 3600X (not worth the extra money for the performance difference) and vastly more affordable than 3700X. If you have the money, by all means go for 3700X or even a ThreadRipper. But if you are not building a super extreme expensive build but still want a great processor, look no further than Ryzen 3600. The prices fluctuate all the time, so be ready for 1000+/- depending on when and where you buy it from. First time I moved from Intel to AMD and I am liking it till now. Remember you will need X570 motherboard for best output and those are expensive too. So your total budget will shoot up. X470 MBs will work with firmware upgrades but to use full features X570 MB is recommended.

  AMD lha fatto. Ha sganciato la bomba. I nuovi Ryzen di 3a generazione sono un concentrato dinnovazione sotto tutti i punti di vista: dal design chiplet con alla base il processo produttivo a 7 nm, passando per il supporto al PCI-express 4.0 fino ad arrivare al massiccio incremento di memoria cache L3.Tutto questo si traduce in un aumento notevole delle prestazioni, mantenendo invariati i consumi e tenendo accessibili i prezzi.Riuscirà lazienda di Sunnyvale a strappare lo scettro alla nemica di sempre?ARCHITETTURAI Ryzen 3000, nome in codice Matisse, si basano sulla microarchitettura Zen 2 di AMD e utilizzano il neonato processo produttivo a 7 nm della taiwanese TSMC. Progettati per il socket AM4, sono retrocompatibili con le schede madri delle precedenti serie 300/400, previo aggiornamento del BIOS.Questi processori usano un primo vero design multi-chip (chiplet) in cui i core x86, prodotti a 7nm, sono affiancati da un controller I/O a 12nm: ciò ha consentito allazienda di non far lievitare troppo i prezzi, poiché i 7nm sono evidentemente più costosi; anzi, AMD è riuscita addirittura a proporre le nuove CPU allo stesso prezzo di listino dei Ryzen di vecchia generazione.PRESTAZIONILarchitettura Zen 2, unita a frequenze di clock più elevate merito del nuovo nodo produttivo, ha portato ad un aumento dellIPC del 15% rispetto alla precedente serie di processori e addirittura del 45% rispetto ai Ryzen di 1a generazione: in soli 2 anni AMD è riuscita ad incrementare le performance di quasi il 50% per CPU della stessa fascia di prezzo.Notevole. Davvero notevole.BENCHMARKSu Geekbench, il Ryzen 5 3600 ha registrato un risultato sorprendente per una CPU di fascia media: con punteggi single core di quasi 6mila punti e multi-thread superiori ai 30mila, supera tutti i processori AMD di precedente generazione, persino il più corazzato Ryzen 7 2700X.CONSUMIConsumi invariati rispetto ai Ryzen di scorsa generazione: AMD ha preferito spingere l'acceleratore sulle frequenze guadagnando in prestazioni.PREZZOIl Ryzen 5 3600 offre un valore eccezionale per quello che costa: al prezzo di 190 venduto e spedito da Amazon, poi, è davvero tanta roba.È la migliore opzione per chi sta assemblando un nuovo PC da zero: batte il Core i5 9600K in praticamente tutte le applicazioni provate e nella peggior situazione pareggia i conti.È anche una validissima opzione per chi due anni fa ha acquistato un'economica B350 con Ryzen 5 1600, ad esempio: basterà aggiornare il BIOS e sostituire la sola CPU per avere un incremento di prestazioni fino al 35% nei giochi e di almeno il 45% nelle applicazioni. Mica male.CONCLUSIONIUn incremento di performance notevole rispetto alla generazione passata, mantenendo il supporto alle vecchie schede madri e prezzo di vendita estremamente competitivo.Io ho già scelto quale processore monterà la mia prossima configurazione. Voi?In sintesiPRO- ottime prestazioni- prezzo competitivo- supporta le schede madri serie 300/400 previo aggiornamento BIOSCONTRO- nessuno rilevato

  Les performances sont au top !, je retire deux étoiles car au déballage du processeur, 3 pinoches étaient tordues !!! ce qui empêchait toute insertion dans le slot Am4 de la carte mère, très délicatement je les aient redressées. Pourtant le processeur était strictement neuf et la boite était bien scellée !! c'est inacceptable de la part d'AMD.

  Die neue Generation von AMD, Zen 2 ist Architektur und fertigungstechnisch ein gigantischer Schritt nach vorne. In den Benchmarks hat zieht man in den Instruktionen pro Takt und bei der Energieeffizienz deutlich an dem Marktführer Intel vorbei und das mit einer sehr attraktiven preislichen Positionierung.Für mich war das der Moment, einen kleinen Zweitpc einzurichten, 16GB RAM, der kleine Ryzen 5 3600, ein 60 Mainboard und eine NVMe SSD zusammen mit einer alten Grafikkarte. Windows war innerhalb von 3 Minuten installiert und kurz darauf auf dem Desktop.Ich entwickle Python Software (Bereich Deep und Machine Learning) und habe daher mal einen Benchmark für typische CPU Aufgaben gebastelt, erstellen von Dictionaries aus synthetischen Daten, sortieren von Daten, Tokenisierung, Erzeugen von Dokument-Term Matrizen und Dimensionsreduktion.Und nun der Schock: Die Software auf dem 3600 20 bis 60% schneller durch als auf dem Hauptcomputer mit 64GB RAM, noch schneller SSD und Ryzen 7 1700X. Und das sind völlig typische Alltagsberechnungen, genau die Dinge die ich im Alltag verwende.Auch die Multithreading Leistung ist extrem gut und behauptet sich in Benchmarks.Meine Einschätzung:Der Ryzen 5 3600 ist eigentlich gar keine Einstiegs-CPU sondern überflügelt vorherige Oberklasse CPUs locker.  Klar, manche aktuellen Intel High End CPUs, die ultra hochgetaktet und viel höherer Verlustleistung rechen, sind in bestimmten Anwendungen wohl noch ein bisschen schneller.Aber der Sprung den AMD hier gemacht hat, ist einfach phänomenal. Der 3600 ist eine sehr sehr schnelle CPU, läuft klasse in aktuellen Spielen, hat eine ordentliche Multithread Leistung, eine CPU bei der niemand vor einem Jahr geglaubt hätte, dass es so etwas heutzutage für 200 zu kaufen gibt.Ein kleiner Nachteil: Der mitgelieferte Kühler ist kein Traum, es geht schon, aber man möchte vielleicht auf etwas besseres wechseln. Aber im Vergleich zu dem Gesamtprodukt ist das geringfügig, diese CPU ist eine Meisterleistung.Mit dem Hauptrechner werde ich nun dann doch auf einen Ryzen 9 3900X umsteigen, einen Vergleich werde ich hier dann noch Ergänzen.

  The 3600 is by far one of the most next gen and competitive AMD CPUs out there to date. Coming from the i7 6700k then to the r7 2700x and now the r5 3600 (wanted better gaming performance) . This cpu is basically a 8700k in terms of raw power and gaming for a really good price while including a cooler and thermal paste its really hard to beat. Almost same performance in work loads as the 2700x of course doesn't have 8 cores but wayyy better gaming performance in certain titles (r6 was around 50 - 70 fps better and csgo was over 150+ difference ) paired with my 2070 this thing is lighting fast. If you are doing heavy workloads with gaming on the side? 2700x or 3700x cause 8 cores is perfect, but for pure gaming the 3600 is impeccable especially at the price. Better than my 6700k at 4.5GHZ, major recommendation

  Questo processore non ha bisogno di particolari presentazioni...una fascia media che scoppia!Processore super versatile forte e competitivo sia nel single core che multi core...Su Cinebench 20 sfiora i 3500 di score.Ho provato anche a fare un po di OC pero con una b450 non si possono fare miracoli....a 3800 ci arrivo oltre inizia a crashare. (ma non sono un esperto!)Lo consiglio a chiunque sia in procinto di fare un upgrade sostanzioso e voglia mantenere la spesa bassa.Io l'ho montato su AM4 B450 MSI Tomahawk sfruttando la funzione M FLASHBACK + che perfette di flashare il BIOS senza uso di CPU montata con una pendrive USB.Ricordo che se volete montare una cpu come questa (serie 3000) su b450 sono poche al momento le schede madri che permettono di eseguire quest'operazione.Altrimenti vi serve essere già in possesso di una vecchia configurazione AMD ryzen per installare il nuovo bios e solo dopo, montare la nuova CPU.

  Monter sur une Asus B450-F le petit dernier d'AMD en as sous le capot !! Certes encore un moins performant que Intel en simple core et en jeu mais en multi core il est aussi performant que le 9700K !!Je suis tomber sur un bon exemplaire, 4.25 pour 1.37 de vcore et 85°C, les 4.3GHz voir plus sont atteignable mais mon 212evo galère à le refroidir... avec un bon refroidissement sa seras possible !!En résumer, le 3600 est le meilleur choix pour un combo très costaud , environ 400 (CM B450, proco et RAM), si le budget est plus serrer le 2600 est 10-15% moins performant pour 100 de moins !!

  Nachdem ich mit großer Freude den Prozessor ausgepackt und eingebaut habe ging es daran den Kühler zu installieren. Und hier hörte der Spaß ganz schnell auf.Aus irgendwelchen Gründen ist AMD auf die \"glorreiche\" Idee gekommen eine Feder um die Schrauben zu wickeln. Das heißt der schraubfortschritt wird jedes mal Rückgängig gemacht wenn man auch nur ein bisschen nachlässt. Jetzt ist der Abstand von den Schrauben zu meinem mainboard (B450M Mortar Titanium) gut ein halber Zentimeter. Ich habe es jetzt nach einer Stunde vergeblichem Schrauben aufgegeben und den Kühler wieder eingepackt. Ich bin halb geneigt das Ding wieder zurückzuschicken, insbesondere da andere im Internet warnen, dass der Kühler dank der Federn den Prozessor zerstört, wenn man ihn abschraubt.Sorry, dann nehmt halt fünf bis zehn Euro mehr und liefert einen vernünftigen Kühler mit, den man auch als Otto-Normal-Verbraucher einbauen kann. Sowas ist echt nur ein schlechter Witz.

  So, starting this review off I've been using my Ryzen 5 3600 for a few weeks on my Asus ROG STRIX x470-f motherboard with Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200mhz DDR4(2X8GB) I've had no issues at all with installation or even getting up and running - besides for the hour of fresh OS install as recommended when changing hardware.First off the installation to the board itself couldn't be easier, drivers and software is all in one handy zipped file on the AMD Support page, one click and a restart and that's it. I like experimenting a little with Ryzen Master and squeezing a little more performance out of it - conveniently on the new version of RM, there's actually a 'Precision Boost' & 'Auto Overclocking' presets which gives worry free improvements as they're all customised by AMD themselves.So with the overclocking max set to 4.26Ghz, RAM boosted to 3,266Mhz and my 980Ti on stock, the gaming experience is definitely worth the £188 I paid compared to my old 1700x (£170).Already off the bat, the single thread speeds were very noticeable providing even better performance in my games but without sacrificing much of the Multithreading speed of the 1700x. I play all of my games on 1080p 60fps, Very High with some 2xMSAA(sometimes 4x if the game is well optimised) and it handles it all really well, give or take a few frames dropped here and there but nothing to frown about considering you're paying less than £200!Temperatures of my 3600 at 4.25Ghz paired with my Hyper Evo 212(With AM4 adapter) idles around 34-40 degrees and is around 65-70 under full load but mostly towards the 60 degrees side and less than 70 Watts of power consumption.I'm planning to upgrade to an RTX soon though because my 980Ti is almost 5 years old so it is starting to feel a little slow and could possibly be holding the Ryzen back a little. Anyway, I digress, for £180-190 this is the closest you're going to get in terms of performance to an Intel i5 chip at a competitive price point!AMD have hit the jackpot with these chips and I can't see why anyone would turn their nose up at the price:performance ratio you can get with a Ryzen!EDIT: I was checking a few recent reviews on here and people complaining about the AMD Rewards as a scam? NOT TRUE AT ALL!I was able to redeem my 3 months of Game Pass back in July with no issues after installing the product verification tool from the site. Apparently a lot of people don't understand how to use computers on here and blame the hardware <U+0001F605> ignore all of the one star reviews.

  Di parole e benchmark se ne sono sprecati tantissimi in giro per la rete, parlando dell'architettura AMD Ryzen.Inutile quindi ripetere in una semplice recensione quello che si è già detto, ma occorre comunque ribadire che finalmente AMD ha un'architettura ottima e con la sua terza incarnazione, i processori Ryzen 3XXX offrono delle prestazioni multi core sicuramente più elevate dei concorrenti intel, mantengono un TDP basso grazie alla litografia mista a 7 e 12 nm e sono comunque potentissimi anche nelle operazioni single core.Quindi costruire un PC basato su architettura Ryzen 2 oggi ha più senso che mai, anche e soprattutto se siete dei gamer.Ma quale Ryzen scegliere?  3, 5, 7 o 9? Ovviamente chi non ha limiti nel proprio budget sceglierà il massimo, ma per chi invece vuole fare una scelta sensata e oculata, il Ryzen 5 3600  è di sicuro un best buy, specie al prezzo inferiore ai 200 nel momento in cui scrivo.Infatti offre prestazioni di tutto rispetto grazie ai suo 6 core fisici che gestiscono due thread ciascuno, quindi in totale offre un parallelismo di ben 12 thread; la frequenza base di 3600 Mhz che viene in automatico incrementata a 4200 Mhz nei carichi più pesanti e l'abbondante quantità di cache, oltre ai già citati processo produttivo a 7 nm e l'architettura Ryzen 2, lo rendono davvero secondo me una CPU molto appetibile per il prezzo a cui è proposto.Inoltre AMD vende queste CPU con tanto di dissipatore e ventola, davvero ottimo se non volete dilettarvi con l'overclock;overclock che è sempre possibile, in quanto tutte le CPU Ryzen sono sbloccate e il Ryzen 5 3600 in particolare offre un discreto margine, a differenza del più costoso e già pompato \"gemellone\" 3600X.Pensate sempre almeno di cambiare la pasta termica con una più prestante come la Artic 5 e di mettere un dissipatore migliore, nel caso in cui vogliate spingere le frequenze.A proposito, AMD ha appunto a listino il 3600X, che non è altro che un 3600 già spinto al limite ma più costoso e con pochissimo margine di overclock.Personalmente ho preferito quindi risparmiare, avere un consumo minore (il TDP del 3600 è di 65W contro i 95 del 3600X) e pensare all'overclock successivamente.Quindi, non ho dubbi: il Ryzen 5 3600 è il miglior processore AMD attuale quanto a prezzo, prestazioni, dotazione e margine di overclock.Ma cosa abbinare a questa bella e prestante CPU?Personalmente mi sono concesso un PC nuovo dopo ben 10 anni e ne ho approfittato per rinnovare un pò tutto:Ho abbinato al 3600 una MB AsRock X570 Phantom Gaming 4, in modo da avere una scheda madre future proof che supporti anche il PCI express 4.0, ovviamente gestito dalla nuova architettura Ryzen;Poi ho abbinato un kit di memoria Ballistic da 16 GB in dual channel a 3600 Mhz, un buon SSD M.2 e una scheda video AMD RX590 (non sono un gamer accanito); Case, alimentatore e accessori, essendo ancora attuali, li ho riciclati dal vecchio PC.Inutile dire che non ho speso poco, ma con 750 circa è venuta fuori una configurazione di tutto rispetto, veloce e prestante.Ultime note:abbinate sempre a queste CPU una buona RAM ad almeno 3200 Mhz;non dovete per forza usare una scheda madre recente e costosa, potete montare questa CPU anche su una economica basata su chipset B450 e l'unica cosa di cui non godrete sarà il PCIe 4.0. Quindi se avete una CPU ryzen 5 1XXX, potete concedervi di passare a questa e avere dei buoni miglioramenti prestazionali, cosa che non consiglio di fare se siete già possessori di un Ryzen 5 2XXX o superiore: probabilmente i miglioramenti non giustificherebbero la spesa.La cosa che adoro di AMD in assoluto è la retro compatibilità: vi basti pensare che ho riutilizzato sul Ryzen 5 3600 il mio vecchio dissipatore a ARCTIC Freezer 7 Pro che usavo sul mio precedente processore su socket AM2, socket che ha ben più di 10 anni! Davvero fantastico.Concludendo, mi pare di non aver altro da aggiungere. Numeri e grafici li lasciamo ai siti specializzati, noi invece ci teniamo i nostri eccezionali Ryzen 5 3600!

  Nelle mie recensioni tendo sempre ad essere un pò critico verso i prodotti. Non perchè cerco sempre il classico \"pelo nell'uovo\", ma perchè voglio cercare di essere più chiaro possibile, nei confronti degli altri utenti/eventuali futuri acquirenti, per cercare di risolvere quei dubbi che l'utenza, molte volte, cerca nelle recensioni. Quindi non parlerò di quant'è \"bello performante\" questo prodotto, lo sappiamo già. Nè di quanto sia fantastico il rapporto qualità/prezzo rispetto alla concorrenza, sappiamo anche quello.Vi dirò invece, come prima cosa, del dissipatore stock: 50 gradi in idle dopo un'accensione prolungata del pc e 77 sotto carico (in gioco), con picchi brevi anche di 80 gradi. In un case della thermaltake con 3 ventole frontali ed una posteriore. PER ME, erano troppi.  Il dissipatore stock del 3600 non è il top. Infatti io ho acquistato un noctua  NH-U12S versione per AM4. Decisamente meglio. Cosa che consiglio anche a voi se non volete spendere troppo, rimanendo nell'ambito della dissipazione ad aria.Lo stesso dissipatore stock mi ha fatto un bello scherzo: svitando semplicemente le 4 viti di supporto alla scheda madre, senza fare forza, senza tirare, insomma, usando la delicatezza necessaria per queste componenti, mi ha letteralmente strappato dal socket il processore. Per fortuna senza conseguenze. Quando è stato assemblato, il dissipatore aveva già la sua pasta termica pre-applicata, ed il processore era stato inserito correttamente nell'alloggiamento. Insomma, non ho fatto esperimenti particolari nell'assemblarlo. Tuttavia mi sento di segnalare l'accaduto.Ultima cosa da segnalare, i voltaggi. Tramite aggiornamenti, AMD sta mettendo un pò una pezza, quindi semplicemente lavorando un pò sui risparmi energetici tramite windows, potreste risolvere eventuali problemi di core che schizzano su all'improvviso semplicemente muovendo il mouse. Per questo tipo di dati, nonchè per controllare le temperature, dicono che il più affidabile sia Ryzen Master, programma che utilizzo anch'io (ma per il gaming, per avere determinati dati sott'occhio, uso la combo RivaTuner + HWinfo64).

  Man muss es gesehen und ausprobiert haben, um so geschockt zu sein wie ich. Die CPU ist sicher nicht schlecht, aber der mitgelieferte Kühler bzw dessen Halterung ist ein NoGo. Man muss die Lüfterhalterung des Boards abschrauben und diesen Lüfter direkt aufs Board setzen, mit Federn unter den Schrauben. Bei einem evtl. Ausbau der CPU sollte man vorher ganz genau überlegen, wie man vorgeht. Zumal bei mir der Verriegelungshebel der CPU ganz bis zum Anschlag aufgemacht werden muß (um sie zu lockern), was durch den Lüfter nicht geht. Man muss also den Lüfter fest auf die CPU beim Ausbau drücken, sonst beschädigt er (duch den hohen Federdruck) die CPU. AMD sollte den Lüfter schnellstens gegen einen besser geeigneten tauschen bzw der potentielle Käufer sollte sich gleich nach einem anderen Lüfter umsehen. Da CPU und Lüfter als Einheit hier zu sehen sind, gibt es von mir 5 Sterne für die CPU und -4 für den Lüfter.

  Fantastic chip, runs as advertised nice and stable on an B450 MSI Tomahawk Max motherboard and 16gb of HyperX Predator 3200Mhz Ram.It all worked together out of the box, though I did update to the latest bios for the board once it was all set up.I'm using an Artic eSports duo cooler and see idle temps of around 40c @30% fan speed and it boosts to 4.2Ghz all core and runs temps of around 60c at 70% fan speeds under a constant load while gaming.Also have this chip coupled with an Powercolour RX 5700XT Red Devil GPU and the system powers through any game I throw at it @1080p on ultra settings @100+ fps.Nearer 80fps on ultra @1440p(Gears 5 ultra settings with advanced  textures)Great performance for a good price

  Ich bin von meinem r7 1700 auf den r5 3600 gewechselt. Jetzt habe ich zwar 4 Threads weniger, dafür aber viel schnellere  Kerne. Was für Gaming nunmal immernoch das Wichtigste ist. Lediglich die hohe Stock Vcore von 1.3 bis 1.4 ist erschreckend hoch für einen 65w TDP Chip. Wenn man den Vcore herunter regelt, läuft der 3600 immernoch stabil, wird aber deutlich langsamer. Der r5 3600 läuft also auf meinem Asus b350-i trotzdem auf Stock und überzeugt mit seiner Leistung. Der Fade Beigeschmack der hohen Vcore bleibt allerdings bestehen. Trotzdem hier kein Stern Abzug. Vielleicht ein Halber :DDer Kühler passt übrigens ohne Probleme... Man muss schon recht inkompetent sein diesen nicht montieren zu können... Die Schlechten Bewertungen wegen dem Kühler kann man also getrost ignorieren!Kaufempfehlung

  (3600) great upgrade from my FX8120, gaming is super on my 1070 playing VR with an Oculus Rift and Mordau and RoE at the desk....looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077.Hasn't been a smooth ride however, mostly my own fault for going with a previous gen mobo (it was way cheaper than even the most basic 570)... BIOS flashing my MSI B450 Carbon Pro was a piece of cake using the Flashback+ feature (I'll admit that experiencing performing a flash without having to get my hands on an older chip was something I was interested in doing and contributed to my purchase of the board.)However the current BIOS is far from perfect, when the rig is up and running it's a peach...but restarting the machine is a nightmare and usually involves between 4-20 attempts before it actually boots.Still, none of that should reflect on the chip, which is a beast for the money...it was my choice to pair it with a previous gen mobo, it didn't expect it to be quite as problematic as it has been though.Balls in Intel's court now...let's see some price cuts lads. Red or Blue doesn't really matter to me, I've had great AMD chips and great Intel CPUs too. Competition is a win for all consumers.

  El mejor procesador de la linea AMD en razon precio/desempeño. Si lo que buscas es comprar poder de procesamiento por el precio mas razonable, esta es tu opcion. Si lo emparejas con una RTX 2060 tendras la computadora gaming mas barata mas poderosa que puedas conseguir. Con casi todos los juegos disponibles hasta el dia de hoy en settings ULTRA para jugar en un monitor 1080p los levanta sin problemas. Totalmente recomendado!

  Worthy upgrade from the Ryzen 5 1600.  Gaming performance is a leap forward and overall desktop speed increase is also very noticeable.  I dropped this into my MSI B350 Tomahawk Arctic motherboard, after installing the latest beta bios and it runs like a dream and lets me overclock my 3200 MHz Crucial Ballistix ram to 3600 MHz, without issue.  Overall, very impressed.

  The CPU is superb - probably the optimal bang-for-buck ratio just now (April 2020). I've had no operational problems with it at all other than the fact that this is 7nm technology and the cores get very hot, very quickly under any kind of decent load and because the chip area is so small heat density is very high creating a more challenging cooling problem. AMD says that the stock Raith cooler is up to the job but I found that under high (95%) loads the cpu was typically running at around 85 to 90 degC depending on ambient conditions. After improving and adding more case fans I got this down to 80 to 85 degC but for me this is still far too hot for extended use and the noise from the Raith was very irritating. I eventually changed the cooler to an Arctic Freezer 34 - the cpu now runs at around 65 degC under the same conditions and is barely audible.

  So I bought the 3600 as a return to AMD after almost a decade with Intel.  I'm not disappointed.I've upgraded from an Intel 4790k and whilst still a solid chip its time was up.  My system was, I started to notice, struggle in a few little areas.  Started being less 'smooth'.  With the current aggressive pricing on the 3600 I decided to invest and then when the 4000 series comes out, I'll pick up a cheaper 3900x or something.To go with my 3600 I bought an MSI B450 Tomahawk Max, 16gb crucial Ballistix ram @ 3600 MHz and a new m.2 ssd.  I reused my old case and seasonic psu.  Unfortunately my Noctua U12s didnt have the correct bracket but more on that in a bit.So, using the stock cooler I set about installing and building it all.  It all went very easy and the stock cooler is the easiest I have ever installed.  Quick trip into the bios to update it and set the ram to 3600 and I was soon installing windows.Two immediate observations, its very fast, and the stock cooler is not great.  It turns out AMD have removed the copper plate and the stock cooler really should only be a stop gap.  Quick check online and Noctua will send you a free AM4 bracket for the U12s so that was ordered.Once back up and running everything is smoother.  And I attribute that to the extra cores as the system can handle so much more.  Even if your game isnt optimized for multi-core you will see a benefit as the system isnt dragging that one core down.Temps wise, as mentioned the stock cooler is not good.  After a gaming session HWMonitor reported it had hit peaks around 95c.  Whilst it can handle that the noise was terrible and the chip likely started throttling.  It idled around 50 too.Performance is all relative but paired with my 1080 on a GSYNC 144hz monitor everything is much much smoother.After receiving the bracket and then installing the Noctua U12s temps dropped dramatically.  Idle around 35 and even though my office is in the attic I haven't seen it go about 79.  I'm very happy with that against a higher ambient air temp.Where this chip really flies is productivity.  To be honest for the price its a steal. and clearly at the time of writing the best bang for buck.

  Nunca tive um processador no nível de i5 ou Ryzen 5 ou melhor, e posso dizer que esse foi o melhor processador que já comprei. Por um preço não tão acessível você consegue performance melhor que o i5 da 9ª geração chegando a bater alguns i7. E nem vale tanto a pena comprar a versão X, comprem uma placa mãe b350 ou b450 pra liberar a opção de overclock e ele ainda vai ser um ótimo processador por alguns anos. Só não consigui chegar aos 4.2 GHz de Max Boost, mas creio que seja por estar usando uma placa mãe a320m, não deve estar entregando a voltagem correta.

  This cpu has more power than most people can use, I upgraded from an fx 8350 and most of the time my cpu usage is 20 to 30 % on all cores and it's pushing my rx590 to 100% all the time very good value for money you really can't go wrong if you need to get up-to-date

  30/07/2020: Updated to 5 star after a year of use. After Ryzen Master finally started to work properly in my rig (don't ask...), this CPU proved to be truly amazing! Very easy to fine-tune on the go, stays cool, and easily clocks to 4.3-4.4 GHz in games, most cases even within the nominal 65W TDP limit! Still happy with its transcoding and folding performance too...at current prices, it is mad value! :)Original review: I have replaced a 2700 with this, and while some may believe I am mad, I think I have made the right choice. It is faster in (most) games, and though not faster in all productivity suites, it is pretty close, and much ahead in HEVC encoding (about 50%, despite the fewer cores), which was of paramount importance for me. The only reason i gave it 4 stars because the acclaimed auto-overclocking is far from being flawless, and BIOS updates are still rolling out every two weeks. Still, with manual setting it humms along nicely at 4.1 GHz on all cores, with 1.25V vcore (with auto, it was fed 1.4V and sometimes even higher at heavy all-core load, while hovering at 4050-4075 Mhz). Stock cooler is OK for everyday use (gaming included - and it even will hit 4.2 most of the time!), and it is not too loud either, but if you want to utilise all 6 cores heavily (like I do with video transcoding), you may want to consider aftermarket cooling (H212 or similar will absolutely do). Overall, a fine product, at a fair price, and I am happy with it :)

  It's amazing how far computer processors have gone recently, for roughly £150 we have everything most users will ever need. My 3900X died for no apparent reason only after 6 months, and while it's being sent to AMD, I got this as a placeholder to keep my system running. All I can say is- wow! I don't feel much of a difference at all, I'm a heavy Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop user, and while there's a difference when exporting big galleries (like 1000 files in one go), the difference isn't that massive to be fair. When doing stuff in Develop module, I almost can't notice any slowdown, it impressed me as 3900x was over £500 when it was launched, and everyone ran short of the stock. It could be due to very high-end other parts in the system (top of the range 3600mh CL16 memory, PCIe4 M.2 drive, top of the range X570 motherboard), which could probably push the CPU to its limits, I've benchmarked it with Passmark, and I've got 22700 points while the average for this CPU is 17800, which is almost 30% faster. Nevertheless, I'm sure no-one will be disappointed with its performance.I highly recommend this CPU, save your money on other parts and don't bother about 3700 or 3800. This CPU is all you need unless it's a heavy multi-core capable stuff, like massive Adobe Premier/Lightroom export, then yeah, go for 3900x or 3950x, but don't waste your money on those middle steps, they're just useless IMHO.Ah, I forgot about gaming- I only play Battlefield 5, and I honestly, haven't noticed any difference at all, the same fps I had with my 3900x. With BF V it's still a GPU that bottlenecks the system, this CPU is enough unless you're pairing it with 2080 Ti on 1080p resolution, which is probably a very unlikely scenario.

  I paired this R5 3600 with an MSI B450M Mortar Max which is updated to support Ryzen 3000 out of the box.The stock heatsink was useless as my system would reset itself about 10 minutes into games like COD and GTA V. I soon found the chip was running at nearly 100C! I managed to get a Wraith Prism cooler and used some Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste which got things stable but I was still hitting 90C so I went and turned off all the Precision Boost Overdrive stuff in the BIOS which got things down to 85C with a noisy fan!I have since added a NZXT liquid cooler which still results in the same temps, just without the noise. The chip performs well but a can't help but be disappointed by the thermal issues. I was hyped about going back to AMD and was expecting better from the 7nm process. Efficiency normally meaning less power use and resulting heat. The chip rarely sees decent boost stats and uses 90W just to hit 3.8GHz. Hate to say it but my 9900K system actually runs cooler and quieter than my Ryzen system.

  Compared to many of the intel chips, the performance over value is amazing and i would 100% recommend for a mid to high end budget gaming PC. Only thing to check is that you motherboard is compatible, many B450 motherboards require a previous gen chips (like a 5 2600) in  order to bios update. So make sure your motherboard is ready out the box or has flash USB bios compatibility.

  Well I bit the bullet and splashed out on some components for a new multipurpose/gaming PC. I was able to reuse some items from my son's recently upgraded machine, namely the PSU, a 500w EVGA, and the GPU, an old but still useful gigabyte gtx1060.I ended up ordering a case, a motherboard, some ram, a CPU and an SSD.I like to support the underdog if possible so I chose the AMD Ryzen 5 3600, from hereon the CPU, even if AMD is not a small company it is still dwarfed by Intel or \"Chipzilla\". I know that this CPU is not the newest or greatest, but it always tops the \"bang for buck\" lists of the tech YouTubers so that's what I got. I won't be demanding too much from my PC, but I don't want a machine that simply just gets by either.It's comes with a perfectly adequate cooler, which is easy to install, after who can't tighten four screws at the corners... I may get a better cooler in time, but for now as I said perfectly adequate.I tested the PC with cinebench and other benchmark software and of course it all falls within the range for an R5 3600, I know big surprise.So to sum up, am I happy? Yes. ANY PC frankly would have been a step up from my old desktop, but to have this CPU instead of one of AMD's APUs with the inbuilt graphics, I think will give me better options for the future. Although not too far in the future, since AMD will replace the CPU socket soon, maybe even this time next year...

  I have built a number of PC's over the years but not for the last three and since then the technology has marched on considerably.This time I was building a PC for my wife who uses Photoshop and needed a reasonably powerful PC to use the program fully. As such I got back into the weeds and started the upgrade to my personal memory module.And I found that Ryzen CPU's from AMD are currently the overall choice for performance vs cost if most of the online reviews, Youtube videos and magazines are anything to go by. Given that most of these views are held by people with far better technical knowledge than I, this seemed to be the way forward.So, which CPU?As ever with unlimited funds one would simply pick the fastest at the highest cost. However, back in the real world I figured two hundred quid or less was my target cost and this Ryzen chip fitted the bill perfectly. Without a doubt it hits the sweet spot and given it's overall popularity I suspect most people making middle of the range PC's feel the same as me.This comes boxed with the cooler and fan which, is not overly large. I appreciate that power users and PC hobbyists may well want something fancier with flashing LED's but what comes in the box works well, maintaining temperatures within spec and is also very quiet. Right now given that the PC I built is not for show I don't see any need to change the cooling arrangement at all.Paired with a decent motherboard this Ryzen CPU blows my old computer into the weeds. My wife is not a gamer but she does use Photoshop a lot as photography is her hobby and it can demand a bit from your PC when doing some tasks. Certainly her old computer struggled and often took quite a while to render some of the modified photographs.Not with this sucker. Now every task is quick and seamless with no waiting around. It makes using heavy duty programs a pleasure not a pain and thus has ticked the main requirement for my wife.Overall, I'm with the majority. AMD have nailed it with the Ryzen CPU's.

  No entiendo mucho de informatica , pero monte un pc a piezas y por consejos le puse este procesador, ha sido una salto impresionante en comparacion con los pc antiguos que tuve. A la hora de hacer streaming en twich , el uso de CPU se pone en un misero 11% como maximo, pudiendo abrir mil cosas a la vez sin que se ralentice el PC.Como puntos negativos , el calor que genera es excesivo, y el disipador que trae no es eficaz. Aunque la temperatura que coge no es peligrosa para el procesador ,  al abrir juegos notas como aumenta la temperatura en el ambiente.Por esto es preferible que lo montes en una caja con buen caudal de aire. En mi caso falle en ese punto y  aunque todavia le tengo el disipador de serie ( que lo cambiare) tuve que instalar varios ventiladores extra en la caja ( de dos que tenia pase a 5 en total , mas el de la cpu y los dos de la grafica) con esta configuración consigo meter mucho mas aire dentro y sacarlo eficazmente ( 2 ventiladores meten aire por el frontal, otro lo mete desde la parte de abajo de la caja ( un espacio vacio que tiene para ampliar los discos duros) otro ventilador saca el aire por detras , y el quinto saca el aire por arriba situandose justo encima del procesador.

  I knew the Ryzen 3600 was good before I bought it - it's so popular by so many people for so many reasons, there's no way it could be a bad choice. Well, I can honestly say I was surprised by how good it actually is.Being somewhat of a budget gamer, I usually upgrade my PC in increments, therefore I knew that I would be pairing the 3600 with an old R9 280x graphics card at least for a year or so before I considered upgrading to an RTX. Bearing in mind that the 280x is almost 8 years old, it's clear the 3600 was going to have some serious heavy lifting to do.Well, it doesn't disappoint. I didn't realize quite how many games were CPU-dependant until I launched them up on my new system for the first time. Games that I previously ran at 30fps with the same graphics card and a lesser CPU suddenly run at 80-90+.Going from 80fps in CS:GO to almost 200 is honestly the greatest feeling.Obviously this scenario is unique to me, and depending on what CPU you had before, what graphcis card you have, your mileage may vary greatly. I can only speak from personal experience, and my personal experience has been incredible.

  I've waited 10 years to upgrade my HTPC. It has a limited power supply (300w) and is used primarily for photography work: this doesn't require a gaming setup, but does require a good CPU, ram and disk, and an adequate GPU. I bought a new Ryzen 5 3600, some cheapish 16GB DDR4-3600, and a 1TB MVNe disk. That setup works very well.The Ryzen happily accepted the 3600MHz XMP profile, and my chip allows boost speeds on at least 2 of the 6 cores. I didn't buy an expensive mobo, but settled for an M-Atx motherboard with the B450 chipset. I can improve memory timings further, but quite frankly, stock XMP (3600) is plenty fast, and overclocking further with tighter timings, doesn't make a huge difference in my type of workloads - maybe just 1-2%. I've also been impressed with AMD's efforts on security, with AES performance receiving a huge boost. Encrypting a hard drive is pretty 'invisible'.So I'm very pleased. This is a huge jump in performance from my previous system.

  Incredible amount of power in such a cheap CPU. I previously had an i7 4770k overclocked to 4.5GHZ and this is definitely faster, in some games I'm seeing a 40-60% increase (more modern using more thread count)I have nothing negative to say about this CPU - Ryzen 3 pushed them past Intel in alot of ways and this processor speaks for itself. 6 years ago I spent £350 for my i7, £150 for this has given me much of the performance of far more expensive CPU's for a fraction of the price. I have an RTX 2060 Windforce OC and 9 times out of 10 my GPU is the bottleneck in games - which cost me £350 in 2019.Most games I can have settings at Ultra or High, with RTX off.Specs1080p 27\"Ryzen 3600RTX 2060 Windforce OCAorus Elite x570Corsair DDR4 3600 LPNoctua NH-D14Corsair TX650M PSU

  The old saying of \"if it's not broken don't fix it\" should have applied to me, sat there happily with my Ryzen 5 1600 but when the 3600 hit the £150 price point I couldn't resist any longer and pulled the trigger. I have to say there are no regrets as after a BIOS update it worked fine with my existing motherboard and RAM and instantly there was a noticeable improvement in pretty much everything on my computer - video encoding, gaming, photoshop and even windows explorer all felt snappier and quicker to complete what was asked of them.As someone who had only had Intel processors prior to my 1600 I have to say there is pretty much nothing they could do at this point to bring me back to their CPUs, AMD have nailed another behemoth processor that I'm insanely happy to be using. If you're sat on the fence pull the trigger, you won't regret it!

  I bought the Ryzen 3600 and a Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition CPU Cooling System for my  ASUS Prime B450M-A Motherboard. I use a Corsair MP510 240 GB M.2 Solid State Drive. This CPU is Exceptional. It is incredible for Content Creation and Video Editing with its 12 Treads running at over 4GHz each and never reached over 65C while been stressed tested in  Cinebench R20, 3D Mark and CPU-Z. These brilliant Temperatures are down to the fantastic Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition CPU Cooling System. I ran many Gaming Tests and it beats all my previous CPUs hands down. Faster then my I7 4790k, 8350k and 9100F even with my very weak GPUs (nvidia 1060 6GB and 980TI). I was surprised it is so much faster then my previous fastest CPU the I7 4790K which is 5 years old. This CPU will still be good in 5 Years time. Bye Bye Intel and Hello AMD, you managed to convert me and many of my friends with this insanely powerful CPU and can not see any reason to buy the more powerful AMD Ryzen 9 or AMD Ryzen 7 as this CPU is so fast and probably too fast for my needs but will age very well and is relatively cheap. I have this chip overclocked to 4.2 Ghz on all cores 24/7 and the highest temperature it reached was 69 Celsius after a hour stress test.

  I got this from Amazon warehouse to knock an extra £5 off the price, but it took them about 10 days to dispatch it and so I didn't get it for about 2 weeks. And then, since it was a warehouse deal, the heatsink had no thermal paste on it!But obviously that has nothing to do with the product itself, which is what these reviews are about, so you can't really knock stars off for that. That's an issue with the seller themselves, nothing to do with the actual product.Anyway, I'm loving the 3600. Install went without a hitch. I'm using a custom watercooling loop, so I just switched the Intel mounting bracket for the AM4 one, and so I can't really vouch for the temps with the stock heatsink. With the loop my temps don't really go above 40c in normal use, and 60c in benchmarks and heavy loads.I had it overclocked to 4.3Ghz for a few days at about 1.37v, just messing around, and had no problems with it. I'm running at 4.2Ghz at the moment at about 1.35v on 3600Mhz non-QVL memory with no problems.But, I must do some proper tests and measurements as it seems that performance can decrease, but still be stable, at lower voltages; It's like, you'll be delighted that you can boot into Windows and be stable at 1.32v, but then you realise your performance has gone through the floor!All in all I'm quite happy playing around with my new toy.

  now in feb 2020 I pay at 154 pounds for this CPU and at this price it was one of best price to performance cpu on market now at well over 200 to 250 pound this is no longer the caseAsk you self is it time to shop as price are sky high due to fact that demand for PCs, laptops and tablets has skyrocketed as the coronavirus pandemic has forced thousands of people to work or study from home so result lot more PC bought and been self built ifthen if you add to this is the effected that virus has had on the supple chain ie part that normal take the industry to ordering six to eight weeks are now taking up to four and six months some times\"Remember that PC hardware move faster than game technology can utilise it\" so hardware that is one or two generation older is in effect what games are optimised for.Now if are going to go ahead look round and check out other CPU in this price range \"search youtube / internet for advice\" you can get a better CPU at this price and may be think about adding an extra £50 to this part of your buget as this will let you take a step up CPU performance

  I think this is what AMD intended Ryzen to be from the off, I have had the 1700X and the 2600 from previous gen. Both excellent in their own right and I learnt alot about Ryzen and it's likes and dislikes, So coming from the Ryzen 5 2600 I wasn't expecting miracles.I got them though, let me explain, on paper the Ryzen 5 3600 has a slightly higher all core boost and double the cache, thats it oh and smaller fab at 7nm. What ever trickey they have going on is working I get a solid 15-20% FPS boost in all current tiltes and a solid 1500-2000 point gain in Firestrike, not earth shattering I admit but when you factor in I sold my 2600 for £100 this 3600 cost me £54 at the time I bought it. Along side that it seems to me at least way more tunable the any previous gen of Ryzen, old Ryzen was just a bugger to tune with RAM and overclocking got them hot if you wanted any meaningful speed say 4.2Ghz compared to 4.0Ghz which is what I settled on with the 2600 as 4.2 just got too hot even with an AIO. Now these Ryzen 3's can run hot if you brute force the OC but instead of that and using the Precission Boost Overdrive and a bit of reading I have my 3600 boosting to 4.4Ghz on sinlge threaded workloads and averaging 4.3 on everything else all at less heat that if I dialed in 4.3 and static voltage.  Now the CPU and it's own limits are controlling the clock speed, much as it would if you just dropped it in stock and let it just run, but with a bit of reading and some time this processor will run so much better, much like GPU's of today the cooler you keep them the faster they go within their limits.So to summerise I'll leave my specs hereMSI X470 Gaming ProRyzen 5 3600 @ 4.4Ghz PBO max boostCrucial Micron E die 3600 DDR 4 @ 3800 16-20-16-16-38And an RTX 2060 under an H55 AIO that now boost's to 2Ghz now that it is no longer thermally limited.Folks overclocking for me at least just became fun again, more like tuning a muscle car than just slapping on some NOS and cooling and seeing how fast she'll go.

  I paid about £167 for the Ryzen 5 3600 including a decent cooler where as the Intel equivalent, the i5-10600K costs £249 without a cooler. Admittedly the Intel I5 is slightly better in benchmarking but it's at least £100 dearer including a cooler.The only downside is the supplied Wraith Stealth cooler is a bit fiddly to install although that's maybe because I've never fitted a CPU & cooler before. It's remarkably good for a bundled cooler as it looks good and it's quiet.Support AMD and the competition will force Intel to stop charging a fortune for it's products.

  Semplicemente il miglior processore che si possa trovare sulla fascia dei 200: rispetto alla generazione precedente abbiamo un notevole incremento prestazionale, una frequenza maggiore (si passa da 3.4 a 3.6Ghz) con un IPC migliore.Nonostante il prezzo maggiorato di 30 di questo rivenditore (al momento della scrittura della recensione), probabilmente dovuto anche all'alta richiesta di questa CPU, consiglio caldamente questo processore a chi è indirizzato verso il gaming + eventuali attività in grado di sfruttare i 6 core messi a disposizione. Attualmente le schede madri compatibili costano ancora parecchio (x570, è compatibile con le b450 previo aggiornamento del bios), quindi per chi come me è passato da un sistema senza CPU Ryzen di generazione precedente conviene aspettare l'uscita delle schede B550, che dovrebbero essere in commercio tra qualche mese.Ottimo voto dato anche dal dissipatore stock che fa un lavoro eccezionale, a patto di non overclockare.

  After ~10 years of using Intel in my own builds, this is my first AMD processor and I don't regret anything about it. Comparable to the i7 8700k (trust me, my brother has it and they trade blows) and costs half the price. AMD has stepped up their game big time with the 3xxx seriesPrice-wise this competes with low end i5s but performance-wise it jumps up to the i7 levels.If you are looking at price:performance, this (or the 3600x) can't be beat for value.For maximum gaming fps: Go for Intel. Keep in mind that you'll pay a hefty premium for about 5% performance gain.For best professional workloads: Currently AMD hands down dominates at same price points.One downside with the 3600 (despite not overclocking it) the cooler is fairly audible when being utilised about 50%. Can easily be solved with a 3rd party air cooler for around £30 or simply upgrading to the 3600x which comes with a different cooler and slightly higher clocks.

  This review is just for the 3600, I can't comment on any of the other 3000 series CPUs, I'm using a inexpensive B350-Gaming-CF motherboard with the latest bios.I upgraded from a overclocked 1700 to the 3600 and I thought I would miss out on the two cores / threads, however, this was simply not the case, I have experienced similair performance to a stock 1700 and a much improved single core performance (I've included a rough CPU comparsion) this CPU is a direct head to head with the I5 7600k and 8600k which is ideal considering all I use my PC for is gaming.Performance in general is so much better and I have noticed a big improvement in FPS,  things feel more responsive and my games seem to open up a tad quicker, the only issue I've had with this CPU is heavily fluctuating temperatures due to the agressive core clock making my fan speed go up and down suddenly, but I had resolved this with a new fan curve and a £20.00 CPU cooler.

  Bought this to replace an old build with an ageing 4690k and not disappointed. Absolute stellar performance for the money. Intel doesn't even come close in performance per pound. AMD have got all CPU tiers locked down and with the (admittedly hard to find) 3100 and 3300X release they've given themselves a bit of a headache - can't make them fast enough!Don't worry about waiting for Zen3; It'll be Socket AM4 so a 4000 series chip will drop right in if you fancy it down the line. Point worth noting, if you purchase this cpu and plan on upgrading to Zen3 make sure you put it in a X570 or soon to be released B550 motherboard.

  Just upgraded from a 1600 to a 3600. Works fine on a Asus ROG X370-F motherboard, all you need is the latest BIOS and just drop this bad boy in. The processor is an absolute powerhouse at this price point and coupled with a Radeon 5700 XT provides the best balanced 1440p gaming system at this time.

  A long time ago in a galaxy far far away AMD finally get their sh!t together andgive Intel a roundhouse kick to the head.Led by Princess Lisa Su and and her loyal engineers AMD have finally hit the jackpot with Ryzen, andit's aging like fine wine, architecture.With more cores than a fruit and veg stall and enough speed to run the Kessel, the 3600 is the new Sandybridge!The only thorn in the 3600 side is its low res gaming performance compared to some of it's intel peers, but with a RTX3080 at 4kthe 3600 produces the same results as the fastest chips in the planet!! (See Hardware unboxed)This, in its self, is a godsend for 4k gamers on a budget.4k youtube with 30 tabs open?Easy peasy!Paint software and FL studio??No sweat!Need a bang for buck upgrade?Look no further because this is the AMD you're looking for.Let's hope this chip lasts as long as the previous bang for buck champ!

  At the price these CPU's are at the moment you cant go wrong. There are newer and faster Ryzen CPU's out but this is more than capable. Really easy to overclock (as all Ryzen are unlocked unlike Intel which is only K series). This uses a lot less power (and therefore a lot less heat to get rid of) then the X series Ryzen but still can perform similar when overclocked. The cooler that comes with this is adequate but I am using an AIO for mine so have not tested it myself. If you are using the stock cooler than thermal paste is pre applied. This particular CPU has no onboard video so be aware if you are building a budget system you will still need a GPU. Compatible with B450 up to X570. An X570 may be a little overkill but it would ensure upgradability as it will be supporting the next generation of Ryzen.

  The CPU is great value for money and offers amazing performance.My only gripe is with the stock cooler. You get a wraith stealth and it is anything but stealth! It makes an annoying whirling sound and needs to ramp up even under little load on the cpu. Forget about overclocking with the stock cooler.Yes the stealth is better than previous stock coolers or intel's stock coolers but that doesn't say much! Let's not kid ourselves, stock coolers are nothing like an aftermarket cooler like the arctic freezer 12 with passive cooling! Get one of those for 15 quid and your are good to go!For the numbers inclined I was idling at 45C with the stock cooler and now I idle at 35C!Huge difference in noise produced and heat emitting efficiency!

  Whats various videos and benchmarks. Unless you have money to burn, going for higher cpu's for todays games seems a tad pointless, this can handle all of them fine, and while some titles do run faster on higher cpu's you seem to be spending a premium for very little extra performance. (Though obviously if you have money to burn......)I upgraded from an fx8350 which seemed to be doing the job, however I have noticed a big increase in a lot of games, in particular older games that generally do most of the work on a single core. (this has twice the single core performance over an fx, for the same ghz).Very happy at my upgrade.

  Needed a low cost fast system. This only works with extra graphics card as none build in, with 2 different Motherboard's, despite previous research and assured worked \" Straight out of the box with MBrd without mentioning Graphics card. Also get annoying messages with Windows 7, that this \"CPU IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR A LATER VERSION OF WINDOWS\"  Finally got rid of message, by applying various drivers to board.  Best buy a CPU with graphics builtin, although this one probably ok in short term for \"Games Machine\" with high cost Graphics card as norm, but gamers keeping up speed would go for a later model.

  Not too sure what to say except, initially everything worked fine then i started having many different issues, my setup was x470 mb and r5 3600. I had to reinstall windows 10 3 times (bearing in mind i have 20+ years software/hardware experience) and really could not understand \"why\" the only logical explanation was compatibility with windows?? This is my personal experience and implies nothing detrimental towards AMD after all I have used them for 20 years, buying 95% of my components from Amazon - BUT decided, regardless of benchmarks to give Intel a go, ie i7 9700-Happy

  Bought the Ryzen 9 3900 from another dealer and had nothing but trouble with it's overheating and eventually just kept switching itself off due to ridiculous temps of over 100° and trying to fit a new cooler didn't work and when I sent it back the other company said they wouldn't replace it BECAUSE it had been opened. However, this was bought off Amazon, and the temps are more like what they should be and just as fast - at least - as the failed Ryzen 9. The cooler was smaller and not impressive on this, but seems to do the job. But pleased with it certainly.

  I bought this CPU because, according to all the reviews, it is the best choice if you. Want a well balanced CPU for gaming to do some occasional heavyweight work.  With its 6 cores and 12 threads It is not only quicker that the corresponding i5 but also beats in a lot of benchmarks some core i7.I'm using it mainly for gaming and I'm very happy about its performance ( with an rtx 2060 is  able to run games at 144p without any problems)In the box you will find also a stock heat sinkI have also received an Xbox pass for 3 month

  There isn't a lot to say about this, for £150 this is the best CPU you can buy in 2019-2020, no question.It was a great upgrade over my 1600, with an easy 20-30% extra FPS in games.The stock cooler is just about doing the job, but it's noisy, and with 50-60C idle, 85C under load, you might want to get a cheap £30 tower cooler and bring the temps down.

  Great product at fantastic price. I have managed to overclock it to 4.1Ghz all cores at 1.3v but cannot get 4.2ghz without using very high voltages and high temperature. I have tried Default, pbo and auto oc settings and it does boost to 4.2ghz on one core but multi core workloads it only goes to 3950mhz all core.

  TL;DR at bottom. Honestly blew my mind with how powerful this little thing is. Paired with a GTX 1060 6GB, I am able to comfortably play any game 60fps 1080p mid-max settings, with the cpu only being about 40% load (meaning that my GPU is holding it back by a lot). Photogrammetry and other mathematically intensive tasks are a breeze when it comes to this CPU, and path tracing in blender is reasonably fast for a CPU of any kind.The temperatures I would say are a little high when using this cooler, although during a stress test I was unable to get it above 93°C. I idle around 50°c and game at around 65-70°C, which is fairly reasonable considering the high voltage (1.444V I believe) and 7nm architecture. I have not experienced any thermal throttlesInstalling is a piece of cake, with the mark indicating the correct rotation, and the CPU cooler (with pre - applied thermal paste) is as simple as tightening it down.I would fully recommend this CPU to anyone looking for a mid-high performance machine in the range of £500 to £1100, as it will not be bottlenecked by almost any GPU.TL;DRVery good value, very good gaming and worksation performance, temperatures reasonable with included cooler, incredibly hard to bottleneck with any modern GPU (within reason). Would recommend.

  Excellent value. Faster than my i7 4790k it replaced, which was a champ of a chip to begin with. Still is. So this Ryzen is a worthy successor. Especially for the price. And I've done a very mild manual all core OC on it and it is working just fine, disabling core performance boost. Undervolting worked great too.

  Este procesador quizá sea el mejor en cuanto a calidad/precio del mercado ahora mismo.Llevo utilizándolo varios meses de seguido para poder hacer una valoración clara, y desde luego, vale cada euro que pagas por él. Lo tengo montado en una X570 de MSI, por lo que no tuve que actualizar los drivers de la placa base, con lo que ya te ahorras dolores de cabeza.El rendimiento es exquisito, para el día a día, con un uso normal, con juegos y con todo lo que le quieras echar encima lo aguanta perfectamente. Sí he de decir que el disipador que trae con el procesador ni lo he tocado, ya que tengo una refrigeración líquida y funciona bastante mejor que un disipador por ventilador. Aunque este procesador no es para nada calentorro, como sí lo era el 2600X del que venía anteriormente, en este caso se mantiene en unas temperaturas óptimas en cualquier momento.En videojuegos se comporta bien, ninguna cosa extraña. En mi caso tengo una Vega 56 de Sapphire, y la combinación funciona muy bien en juegos como Fortnite y Devil May Cry 5 que ha sido donde lo he probado.Ningún tirón, pantallas azules ni nada por el estilo, por lo que considero que su relación calidad/precio es lo mejor que hay, con el rendimiento que ofrece.

  Just superb processor for the price. So pleased having upgraded from an i7 2nd gen. Installed easily into a B450 board, upgraded the fan to an RGB prism (usually sold with R7 2700) for extra prettiness.Do note you must have a graphics card to use this. Also note that some b450 boards will need to be updated to work. Suggest MSI boards for this purpose.Used for videography and gaming with vega56. Example: 230fps on overwatch epic settings.

  Bought it here instead of Overclockers UK and SCAN due to list price, shipping price, and ease of returns.Item itself is as expected, runs kinda hot at stock so I set an offset undervolt.I appear to have not won the silicon lottery and it struggled to boost itself to over 4.1 for any length of time on more than one core, but it doesn't really matter in games. Still a huge improvement in minimum fps over my old X58 6-core Xeon which was overclocked to 4.2 GHz, so the frequency isn't everything.

  Bought this CPU as part of my first gaming build. Though by any means it is not the fastest CPU on the market, it packs more than enough processing power for gaming on my build at 1440p.Installing onto my motherboard (X570) was mostly straightforward, the chip itself clips in nice and simply. I'm using the stock cooler that comes with the chip, getting all the screws in place and tight was a little tricky but I got it fixed on eventually (tip: screw opposite corners in first!).

  This was CPU bought for a \"ground up\" new PC build as, in my estimation at the time, this was a good balance between price and available performance.  In reality it would have been just as effective for me to utilise one of AMDs smaller (and cheaper) Ryzen processors, as it has proved quite difficult for me to get as many as half of the threads working at any time. One the plus side, with the stock cooler under \"normal\" loads, this CPU claims to be operating at between 40 and 50 Deg C which I still find amazing.

  3600 is a fantastic CPU for gaming especially for the price. installs very easily (providing you have the right mobo). I replaced the standard wraith cooler with a Hyper 212 RGB Black cooler and would recommend an alternative CPU cooler if you plan on gaming heavily as the CPU can run hot!fits in my b450-f gaming mobo, with no need to flash the bios, and it sits alongside an rx 5700 and does the job.For price to performance, definitely well worth it!

  My previous processor was a Ryzen 3 1300 barely capable of working with 1080p according to Black Magic Raw Speed Test.  A two minute upgrade to a processor now easily capable of working with 4K and it appears 6K after running the speed test again.  Overall the system is much quicker, mouse clicks open apps with barely a delay, everything just seems a whole lot more responsive and supercharged as a result.  Hopefully editing in Davinci Resolve shouldnt be a problem!

  this is a good piece of hardware but a BIOS bug was causing random shutdowns and turns out it was due to \"power down enable\" being turned on. Which, for some reason, causes the RAM to go into sleep mode and resets your PC.Apart from that absolutely idiotic software bug, very happy with the purchase. Made installing and overclocking way more of a pain than it needed to be though. Makes the chip appear far more unstable than it is.

  Was looking forward to putting together my new PC but when I checked what had been sent, I noticed it was a used FX8350 in the ryzen 3600 box. Minus star option not available. I'm sure when I do get a proper 3600 I'll be able to give it 5 stars.

  hab von meinem Ryzen 5 1600 auf den RYzen 5 3600 geupgradet .Das erste was mir aufgefallen ist das der Lüfter um ca. 40% kleiner geworden ist.Naja dachte ich mir wird wohl eine verbesserte Varriante sein. Aber von Wegen.Der Kühler ist lauter und kühlt schlechter ! Man merkt das ordentlich am Kühler gespart wurde.Langsam fäng Amd an wie Intel ! Bin echt enttäuscht

  Bought this as my 2100 was using 100% cpu in warzone. Now using around 35% which is a massive jump. Thermals on the cpu so far are fine. I use the wraith cooler supplied and it runs while gaming around 51 degrees in my rig. Overall very happy with this cpu for the cost.

  This chip turned my base level AMD A8 machine  in to a mid level gaming platform. Runs well on a AsRock A320 Rv4 motherboard and sucks the data from SSDs. Running with a gtx1050ti card as no built in GPU frame rates and response time make for a balanced performance and excellent all round power house. Idle temperatures seem fine compared to others and being supplied with thermal paste and cooling fan make it ready to roll from the box.

  Amazing - replaced an i5-4960k and its night and day. PUBG, whilst not the most demanding out there used to be sitting my CPU at 95-100% and therefore was stuttering. This happily sits 20-30%, ultra settings with a GTX1070 and no problems at all. AMD you have converted me!

  I'd love to inform anyone whom might buy this processor for himself with combination of this \"Dedicated\" motherboard MSI B450 GAMING PLUS Socket AM4 ATX Motherboard for AMD Ryzen Processors.Before buying this processor and motherboard ask amd or msi to either send u older version of processor for free or force MSI to Update BIOS on all motherboards on stock across world.Pc doesnt start up untill you will update bios that means untill you're gonna put OLD amd processor for example 1st gen, then start up pc, than update bios... otherwise motherboard doesnt see DESIGNATED PROCESSOR.

  Great price for performance and a good overclocker. The 6 cores are enough for gaming and most productivity workloads, only get the 8 core 3700 if you really need those extra two cores.My advice though would be pair this with a good cooler like a Evo 212. You dont technically need to as Ryzen run at good temps, but a good idea and gives you headroom for overclocking. This CPU will achieve (in my case also) a solid 4.4ghz on an overclock if not more.

  An excellent product, through and through.Much faster than my old i5-4440, and uses far less power. My first time with a high end AMD CPU, and I am not disappointed.It's much cheaper than an equivelant Intel counterpart. My only complaint is that there don't seem to be any drivers for Linux to read the CPU temperature, but I think that's more my motherboard's fault (an ASRock Phantom Gaming 4).

  As I had few problems with my bit older system I have upgraded it using this CPU. Previously had Ryzen 7 1700 (8 Core 16 Thread)This CPU with 2 less cores (6 cores 12 Thread) is faster than my older one. My system has become more responsive, loading times has dropped, web browsing on Chrome is much faster and it's great for gaming.AMD is overtaking their main competitor without a doubt. If you are looking to upgrade and have limited budget go for this CPU. You'll be surprised with performance you get.

  Ooooooooh!What a treat. Upgraded from Xeon E3 1230 v2. First couple of boots things were slower but Windows has adapted and now no lag or blurry transitions (not that they were evident...its just so much snappier now comparing it to old chip).The cooler is a revelation! So quiet its literally a low hum whisper even at 4Ghz.So far, so fab!

  Initially bought this for my budget build and it has turned out quite impressive for the price which is decent with the performance to price ration compared to the Intel CPUs. No problems with the CPU so far and it's already unlocked so a bonus if you want to overclock the CPU without having to pay extra like the Intel chips, highly recommended for gaming or just normal everyday workloads and it's highly efficient and works like a gem

  I got this as working at home I needed a bit more CPU for compiling large projects and running multiple 3D applications at once (I'm a software developer). After a bit of research got this with an Asrock Steel Legend motherboard and a CoolerMaster 212. After a little fan tuning, I now have plenty of power for gaming and working with a near-silent PC. Absolutely perfect for what I wanted and without breaking the bank.

  These are now at a great price.I made a couple of new machines with these and they are fast.I would say don't use the aie coolers that come in the box and upgrade to a water cooler.With the air cooler they run too hot, but with a water cooler they are great and you won't have any overheating problems.Use a good thermal past and you will be set.

  Installed and tested, and it's a good CPU. Haven't done any OCing as that's not my bag, but it hits boost automatically and does what it needs to without ado.Temperatures with the stock cooler are a problem, the provided cooler simply isn't up to it. Temps easily hitting 95°c and thermal throttling. An aftermarket cooler solved this perfectly well, and now temps are better than expected.Very happy overall.

  Helaas door erbarmelijke DHL praktijken, was het pakket helaas ' verdwenen'  tijdens de bezorg procedure. Echter was de communicatie hierover met de verkoper keurig. Tevens hebben ze laten weten dat er sinds enkele dagen na mijn bestelling niet meer met DHL samengewerkt word. Heb vrijwel direct een volledige retour betaling gehad van mijn bestelling, en heb een uitstekend telefonisch gesprek gehad met de klantenservice waarin al mijn vragen uitvoerig werden beantwoord.De dame in kwestie heeft zich uit de naad gewerkt om te zorgen dat mijn ervaring toch nog positief kon zijn, wat uitstekend is gelukt. Dus geen kwaad word over de verkoper! Als ze al hun klanten zo behandelen dan zullen ze het nog ver schoppen als bedrijf.

  It's a fantastic chip runs anything you throw at it but also throws back a lot of heat which proves too much for the wraith stealth cooler it comes with reaching up to 91.4 degrees averaging 86 on warzone at only 20 to 35 percent usage. Although while stress tested it maintained 90 to 94.7 with a few spikes to 95 degrees c under 100 percent load while maintaining a boost clock just below 4.1 ghz around 4.09 which is ok but certainly not ideal. So if you do buy this cpu PLEASE make sure to buy an aftermarket cooler such as the arctic freezer 33 esports which you can get for 20 pound with prime during covid 19. This will help you chip last over a year and stop it throttling down to give you the performance this chip is capable of.

  I have two of these. The older one is OK. Good performance and value for money. The most recent stepping in the newer one, however looks like it has the boost cranked up to a ridiculous setting. The stock cooler barely copes, 7xCO also fails to cool. I have ordered a cooler for 125tdp+ cpus to keep things under control.

  Works great, With the 6 cores and 12 threads its able to multitask with ease while gamingI had Warzone open and no stutters while watching YouTube or have google open, discord and wall paper engineBought it to pair with the 3080 then later upgrading to 4000 seriesIn gaming wise its 10-15 FPS less than i9 10k seriesPrice to performance 10/10 from amd

  Very strong CPU for the price, works as expected. One thing that disappointed me was that 1 of the pins on the chip was slightly bent and so wouldnt fit into the chipset, however I couldnt be bothered to send it back so I bent it back into place and now it works great. The stock cooler runs average games well however I noticed on the new Call of Duty Warzone BR, the temps often go into the high 80s which isnt great so I have purchased the arctic freezer esports duo cooler.

  I changed the Wraith after a week (mostly having been spoilt by huge CPU coolers in the past)Unless you constantly chase the bleeding edge - anything with 4 Cores and 8 Threads or more is perfect right now; get a Noctua Cooler NH-D9L or bigger NH-U/D15 and you won't need a new CPU for at least 5 years

  The best cpu you can get on a budget. Brilliant performance for any task or gaming. The included cooler is on the weak side so its recommended to get something better if you want to fully utilize the CPU... with heavy tasks the stock cooler can hardly keep it under 83C in an ordinary case with average or low airflow.

  3600 Very fast cpu, 6 core processor hyper threaded to 12, so should give years of service. Cpu cooler supplied is adequate however after testing I opted to fit an aftermarket cooler, this was for peace of mind long term reliability as the pc built will be used for many hours of gaming.

  Very powerful CPU but does run hot on boot this baby idles at 60c admittedly this could be due to my installation of cpu fan and the fact the stock fan isn't great but managed to get it down to 55c with some mobo setting and setting windows performance mode to balanced would recommend but might have heat issues.

  CPU runs smoothly, no jittering, no bottle necking and no drop in performance.Out of the box, all cores were at 4.0ghz which was a nice surprise and consistently remain there.Initially looked into Intel and can honestly say that AMD have knocked it out of the park with this CPU.Don't get how anyone bends pins on them either, super easy to install as it practically drops into place. Wouldn't recommend the stock cooler as they do run quite hot, spend the little extra and get a Hyper212 EVO to keep it cool.

  I love this CPU, it was a massive upgrade from my old pc which was slow and couldn't handle games very well.The stock cooler gave me a bit of an issue installing it onto my motherboard, so I had to take the stock cooler apart and rotate the inside of it so the AMD logo wasn't causing any clearance issues with my ram. Also the stock cooler averages 45°c to 50°c when idle, and 45°c to 75°c when gaming.

  Great CPU. You might want to turn off the turbo in your mother board settings if you find that it runs hotter than you want. Just look up how to do it for your motherboard (its different for each).I found that the heatsink that comes with it is more than adequate for my use I do some gaming and development it doesn't run too hot. (I didn't overlock it)

  The R5 3600 is easily the best CPU on the market for people who plan on building a gaming/streaming PC, even better for those upgrading from an older one.For £300 you can get yourself this CPU, 16GB of 3200MHz ram and a great gigabyte auros B450 motherboard.In gaming I saw massive improvments over my older i7 3770, especially when multitasking.With recent windows updates it improves the responsiveness of general usage by quite a lot, even using my older SATA SSD I can feel that this is miles faster than my older PC.

  Con la generazione Ryzen 3000 AMD ha finalmente fatto quello scatto in avanti in più che serviva alla competizione con Intel!La CPU è davvero fantastica! Scalda quanto un normale intel i5 versione K ed ha una % prestazionale praticamente pari al suo rivale i5 9600k (e costa anche meno).State attenti però a quale tipo di mobo lo associate, non ci sono ancora in commercio (29/07/2019) le b550 ed una x570 è un pochino sprecata per il livello di fascia di questo processore. L'ideale per rismarmiare anche qualche soldo sarebbero le b450 ma non tutte sono aggiornatte all'ultima versione del bio, quindi fate attenzione che quella che volete acquistare abbia il flash da chiavetta usb (questo nel caso non possediate già una cpu 2 gen.).Rispetto la mia vecchia cpu (i5 6600k a 4.6 ghz overclockata) si ha un utilizzo medio di cpu sui giochi del 35-40% (rispetto al 9600k che era di circa il 75-80%).Ottima non solo per giocare ma anche per utilizzo semiprofessionale e utilizzo di programmi di video editing e foto.Ottima anche per lo streaming su twitch, senza lag o grosse perdite di frame a 720p 60 fpsN.B. Sto ancora testando il sistema completo (gtx 1080, hyperx fury 3200mhz, modulo m.2) quindi prendetelo con le pinze, sono solo prime impressioni dopo qualche test.

  I have always been an Intel user, but recently they have not made many improvements on the architecture since Intel 5th/6th Gen. I was in need of an upgrade, specially for higher core count as games make use of them and you dont get any FPS drop. This was easy to install and the included cooler seems to work fine. A bit loud at times during gaming, but I will soon replace the cooler. Other than that, an excellent chip, a move I would have never of thought of doing since last year.

  On installing the CPU the stock Fan/cooler was making a loud noise, on removing the fan from the heatsink i found a large piece of plastic (not from the fan itself) that looked like a plastic washer was loose inside the fan. Once removed and the fan reinstalled the issue was resolved. I shouldn't have had to perform a task like this as the unit should have been checked at the manufacturing stage.Hoping this is the last issues I have with the CPU.

  CPU works like a charm, but throttles with stock cooler; Wraith Stealth isn't enough to cool it at 70% load, and cant cool cpu down from 80 degrees. I recommend the cpu for all round gaming, but not with the cooler that comes with.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  So I bought this CPU in July for £159 brand new, after I've seen the price increase I am glad I bought it before all my other parts. I also have to say that this is a very good CPU as it does everything you really need, I have it running with a Nvidia RTX 3070 Founders Edition that I got for MSRP £469.

  
"

  I clearly didnt win the CPU lottery, because the best setting i can achieve a stable system, is at 3.9GHz clock, barely a fraction above the default setting, and no where near the advertised 4.2 Ghz. Can't fault the value for money, for what is a really decent processor.

  Fantastic option to upgrade too, if you're coming from the first gen Ryzen. I had a ryzen 1400 andThere was a substantial increase in performance in cpu bound games, with an RX580. In CSGO I've gained around 100 fps. Before I averaged around 140, after installing this puppy. It's around 240-280.Only thing is the stock cooler. The CPU can get toasty if you run it at 4.2 boost clocks.80+ degrees sometimes, so getting an after market cooler might be a good investment.Otherwises. Thank you to Lisa Su and the teams at AMD for cracking out fantastic products.

  Ryzen 5 3600. Fantastic CPU comparing to price. Had a little issue with teperatures, stock fan not the best option for gaming.  Ryzen 3000 series are very hot. 85° while gaming. If you need lower temperatures, you can edit some things like volting(-22° teperatures drop idle also gaming after this) or buy a better CPU fan. For basic work and not ultra settings gameplay is  stock cooler enough.

  I have recently purchased to upgrade my brothers system, this CPU is awesome value. I've hit 4.2 on all cores at 1.25v, with temps maxing at 49oc while gaming.

  Installed on a MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX overclocked to 4.2GHZ on all 12 Threads 24/7 and paired with a 5700XT Nitro+ and it blasts through any game I run on it. I highly recommend getting the 3600 instead of the 3600X as if you disable the PBO and OC all the cores to 4.2GHZ (or if you can get your chip higher happy days) I scored 1688 on Cinebench R15 for anyone wanting some performance numbers.

  Order was delivered promptly, but sadly that's the last positive. The CPU itself was dead on arrival, which is no big deal I've had that plenty of times with computer components. I requested a return and sent it back to the seller three weeks ago and haven't heard a peep back from them. I've attempted to contact the seller through Amazon and have been in touch with Amazon customer services to try to get my refund. The whole experience has been quite disheartening and it's all together very poor customer service.

  No por nada es la elección preferida desde el año pasado para gaming de gama media, me ha manejado 4.2Ghz a 1.4volts con el ventilador stock. Excelente rendimiento, las frecuencias lo ponen a la par de un Ryzen 7 3700x para quien solo quiere el mejor gaming posible por el menor costo posible y sin mucho interés en producción o trabajo (por aquello de los 6 nucleos vs 8 del R7). Lo tengo emparejado con una 1080Ti en una MSI B450 Tomahawk. Con suficiente OC he logrado 9500+ puntos en Time Spy de 3DMark Benchmarks, sin embargo creo que es posible llegar a los 9700, pero aquí llego al punto negativo de este procesador: El stock cooler es insuficiente para llegar a los 4.3Ghz, ante completa presión en todos los nucleos supera los 90°, lo cual ya comienza a ser peligroso para su integridad. Si se busca overclock mas allá de los 4.1Ghz es NECESARIO cambiar el enfriamiento, por lo que sugiero lo consideren en el costo total de su equipo.

  If youre reading thism you probably already know the specs of it. TLDR, this is amazing!!! Miles ahead of my 6600k and not just in gaming. General video editing, streaming feels much much better.

  What an amazing CPU for such a low cost. Smashes my previous i7-7700K out of the park. Got this paired with a Arctic Duo 34 eSports (2x fans in push, pull config) and highest I have seen my temps go is around 48c.If you need a \"gaming\" CPU and don't want to fork out £££'s then this one is for you.

  Used in a new pc build and installed with no problems. Great value. I didn't use the stock cooler, used an aio but I'm sure the stock cooler would do the job anyway.

  What can I say?AMD is the budget cpus you can get.I was going to get the 3600x but after some research I chose this one and overclocked it.100% recommended.

  Ryzen 3 has so many options that is hard to get the sweet spot. I regret to purchase this one because for a little bit more I could get the 7 . I may change it later on anyway.

  I have to say I've been blown away by this processor. I bought it for my new small form factor (SFF) build, and the performance is nothing short of incredible. I'm now tearing through games my machine was struggling with before. I didn't realise a processor could make this much difference.Highly recommended. This is probably the best price to performance processor around at the moment.

  If you are wondering whether to buy this or not, BUY IT. it is a really powerful cpu for its price and it has great perks like free game pass and a stock cooler. Albeit a really bad stock cooler for overclocking. Overall a great price for performance cpu

  The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 is pretty much the best CPU when it comes to price to performance as of the time of writing.If you are gaming, editing, streaming or doing basic office activities, this CPU will not let you down.

  The CPU runs great, but its stock cooler leaves a lot to be desired. The CPU is frequently idling between 60 and 70 degrees Celcius and reaches beyond 90 under load (such as gaming). I would recommend buying an aftermarket cooler to pair with this chip, just be sure the cooler is compatible with AM4 and has adequate RAM clearance.

  the cpu fan is pretty tough to install took me 4 attempts and reaplications of mx-4 paste to get it on, use the X corner method but only a lil bit each turn not fully and you may have to hold the backplate on ur mb while doing this, and the amd logo is limiting space for my ram slots cuz my io panel is in the way otherwise the cpu itself is good no complaints

  Brilliant CPU from AMD (Ryzen 3600) and turbos up to 4.1GHz for me using the stock cooler. Very loud and annoying cooler though, you can tell they cheaped out on this bit.

  If your looking for a good and reliable cpu PURCHASE THIS. Its really easy to install and after using I could barely hear the fan. There was just one problem I could screw in 3 screw for the fan but the 4th one wasnt going in Im not sure if that was the fans fault or the motherboard but the pc works perfectly

  This has been said multiple times however the Ryzen 5 3600 really is the best CPU for the price as its cheap and offers such a smooth and good experience as long as its paired with the correct hardware. Perfect for any game to date and the only thing you will need to worry about is your GPU for years to come.

  I have used this CPU for over a month now, and I have to say I am nothing other than impressed with what it has to offer for the price. As an upgrade from a Ryzen 1700 it provides a noticeable boost to performance in games and single threaded applications. On top of that it was an easy drop in replacement after a bios update to my x370 motherboard. Highly recommended

  The price-to-performance ratio of this product is out of this world. It is hard to see how Intel can compete with AMD these days. The perfect all-around CPU around this price point.

  Great processor, amazing performance and value for money. But the price has been shifting twice a day. I know it's not a huge issue, but definitely leaves a poor taste when you see it for £155, can finally buy it for £165, only for it to be £155 the next day.

  Not much to say about a cpu , i have an rtx 2060 super mini and it works amazing with it. I really really recommend getting an aio or an after market cooler because with the auto turbo boost it will easily exceed 80° especially if you are a high demanding player

  This processor can handle multiple tabs open, streaming and gaming at the same time easily! I paid £150 and it was definitely worth it. I would recommend this to anyone who is building their first pc or anyone who is looking for a cheap but powerful upgrade!

  I had to return this as my temperatures were all over the place no matter what I did or how I tried my fans would spin up and down and were so loud I had to go back to my 1700 chip

  This is a great upgrade from my ageing 4th gen i5 system. My one complaint is that i would invest in a better cooler since the included one isnt up to the challenge. Even with no overclock, the CPU easy hits 90°C at full load.

  If you want a CPU thats Bang for the buck you can't get any better than this, runs really well and easy to install.Works best with 3200mhz to 3600mhz DDR4 RAM for best performance ^^Also it punches above its weight for £154.00 value i got beating even most of the Intel 9th Gen i7 processors

  Mit dem Ryzen 5 3600 ist AMD ein tolles Stück Silicium gelungen. Die Rechnerleistung ist wirklich enorm. Wie aus zahlreichen Tests hervorgeht, schlägt er in Benchmarks auch deutlich teurere Prozessoren. Somit hat er in seiner Kerndisziplin durchaus 6 Sterne verdient. Allerdings muss ich für den boxed Lüfter gleich wieder einen Stern abziehen. Der Lüfter ist verglichen mit dem boxed Kühler eines Ryzen 7 2600x deutlich kleiner und wird damit letzten Endes zu laut! Da es aber auch relativ günstig Prozessorkühler (z.B Arctic Freezer) gibt, bekommt der Ryzen 5 3600 von mir trotzdem die 5 Sterne. Noch eine Bemerkung: Für alle Destiny 2 Spieler gibt es mittlerweile einen vorläufigen Chipsatztreiber, ohne den das Spiel nicht startet.

  I upgraded from a Ryzen 3 2200g and the performance difference really is night and day. Much higher and stable framerates in gaming and my fan doesn't need to keep up as much because of the extra cores sharing the work-load.Temps are also lower than my older 2200g. I really couldn't ask for more; I'm very happy with it.

  This cpu has breathed a new air of life into my pc, replacing my old Intel i5. Even whilst using an old 960, the performance with this cpu is great and I highly recommend it. The only issue I'd say was the installation of the fan to the motherboard, but other than this there have been no issues.

  Best CPU in this price bracket by a country mile - leaps and bounds better than the Intel i5, and for the price you really can't go wrong. Stock CPU cooler is okay - If you can afford one, I'd recommend a slightly higher spec though.
